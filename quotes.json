It bears the memory of possibility, of unknown forests, unchartered territories, and a heart light and skipping, hell-bent as the captain of any of the three ships, determined at all costs to prevail to the new world. Turning back was no option. Whatever the gales, whatever the emaciation, whatever the casualty to self, onward I kept my course. My heart felt the magnetism of its own compass guiding me on—its direction constant and sure. There was no other way through. I feel it again as once it had been, before it was broken-in; its strength and resolute ardency. The years of solitude were nothing compared to what lay ahead. In sailing for the horizon that part of my life had been sealed up, a gentle eddy, a trough of gentle waves diminishing further, receding away. Whatever loneliness andpain went with the years between the ages of 14 and 20, was closed, irretrievable—I was already cast in form and direction in a certain course.When I open the little bottle of eau de toilette five hundred different days unfold within me, conversations so strained, breaking slowly, so painstakingly, to a comfortable place. A place so warm and inviting after the years of silence and introspect, of hiding. A place in the sun that would burn me alive before I let it cast a shadow on me. Until that time I had not known, I had not been conscious of my loneliness. Yes, I had been taciturn in school, alone, I had set myself apart when others tried to engage. But though I was alone, I had not felt the pangs of loneliness. It had not burdened or tormented as such when I first felt the clear tang of its opposite in the form of another’s company. Of Regn’s company. We came, each in our own way, in our own need—listening, wanting, tentatively, as though we came upon each other from the side in spite of having seen each other head on for two years. It was a gradual advance, much again like a vessel waiting for its sails to catch wind, grasping hold of the ropes and learning much too quickly, all at once, how to move in a certain direction. There was no practicing. It was everything and all—for the first and last time. Everything had to be right, whether it was or not. The waters were beautiful, the work harder than anything in my life, but the very glimpse of any tempest of defeat was never in my line of vision. I’d never failed at anything. And though this may sound quite an exaggeration, I tell you earnestly, it is true. Everything to this point I’d ever set my mind to, I’d achieved. But this wasn’t about conquering some land, nor had any of my other desires ever been about proving something. It just had to be—I could not break, could not turn or retract once I’d committed myself to my course. You cannot force a clock to run backwards when it is made to persevere always, and ever, forward. Had I not been so young I’d never have had the courage to love her.\"\n    ―\n    Wheston Chancellor Grove,\n    \n      Who Has Known Heights\n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n",

Once you understand someone, and if you like the person so much, I tell you, with your understanding, you can tolerate whatever the person does.With wisdom and knowledge, it is expected we seek first to understand than to be understood.

One flutter along the walls of your stomach, and you realize they've invited company.

Boy walks in with an electric stare, girl smiles at him, with her lightning coloured hair - blond-white, electric, and diffusing florescent lighting - falling on top of her eyelids that carry evergreens.Girl walks in two worlds, under two collapsing skies,she listens to moth wings mimic footsteps, as they crash into streetlights, and she also walks in the world of butterflies. Chaotic creatures they are, someone once told her, they leave behind the dust of a polar catastrophe,she knew that were true, when she saw butterfly dust using his skin as a landing pad - she knew there were two lovers, with distance stretched horizontally,kissing goodbye off of each others lips, somewhere in an airport,with a foreign way to say the last words before goodbye.Boy walks in the world of daylight, sun rays, butterflies, summer days - his eyes like marble suns, shining on the rippling surface of the ocean. Girl walks in two worlds, the sun and the moon,boy only comes out when the sun is blinding, and moth wings are silent. It's the same old story told under a shivering sky, as butterflies brush against its skin.

There is a lifetime behind me, where you still linger &roar - so loud you'd shatter thunder. They don’t know it, but every so often, I still feel the earthquakes from your footsteps after goodbye - they rattle my bones, and the diminutive space, between toes and tile flooring. I feel your ghost haunting me to shambles - my fingertips carrying aftershocks years after, my grip slipped from the pull of your hands. You are the 2am blues - veiling radio static, the soundtrack of crickets roaring, and a pandemonium of cheers, screaming for your encore. They do not wicker the same way they did, without you here. Sometimes the mere thought of you, shakes layers off my smile -Some nights, layers shed to the marrow. You were headlights in broad-midnight - approaching at light speed, 50 kilometers an hour, to a destination 350 kilometers from here. You are the intervals of rest stops where silence breaks openlike eggs cracked on the sides of frying pans, on an element not yet heated. Silent, a lull before the sizzle. These days I'm lucky if my eyes make that match-sparking,cigarette lighting - the wicker of a drag without you here, kind of sound.We were time capsules shredded paper thin, that couldn’t stand a test of time. Your dim-lighted kitchen where you sparked your 5:36am, sunny side up, kind of smile. You’d make a mad-dash out the door, at 6:15am.You played your guitar strings, the same way the moon plays the heartstrings of the sea. Sometimes, on the colder nights, you see him combing silver-tide strands of the oceans hair. The shoreline looks a lot like a hairline, on the nights the sky fractured. You played your guitar, until your fingers became raw. You sang about a thousand wild horses running; hooves hitting, like thunder striking in between the soles, & sandy landing pads. A thousand wild horses running - rattling so loud, I bet you could pick up its faint echo - in a coffee shop - on the dimly-lit side, of South Carolina. Cobalt blue, with lightning strikes, every time your lips sparked your eyes, The first night sitting in your dimly-lit kitchen, with the last lifetime collapsing inside of itself. Nothing felt like home, even to this day, quite like the way I did, in the four walls of your smile, other than the days of pixie-sticks, & bicyles riding inside of childhood, with enough leftover loam, to fill the cracks of structure and the leaking parts of time.\"\n    ―\n    Amber Dawn H.\n",

We explored the depths of each other, more than we explored any city or town, that smiled in half delight to see us driving in. We were covered by the stars, sometimes comet tails - in weepy little towns, where We stretched our smiles towards the sky -the sky extending his smile back down - sometimes on the nights of deep reverie,it'd crease into the form of Aurora Borealis, staining our west coast. Sometimes on the outskirts of the city lights, you can see it,curving into a radiant green.\"\n    ―\n    Amber Dawn H.\n",

You told me my smile was too bright, my fingertips too electric, to survive the topsy-turvy town, too tipsy&tepid on weekday to keep the milky way dust in place, enough to get a candid picture. You told me when I write myself out of here to send an autograph signed with galaxy ink.\"I've stained enough poems with you already.\" I say. Here I am here you are again, The sace dwindles between usHere I am - here you are again, You arent' tinged like mocha, pretty-in-pink clouds, or an almost-sweet-16 sunset, You tinge the way wolves tinge the drab bathroom stalls, chocolate milk lovers, snarling and showing their half grown wisdom teeth. You are tinged like the introverts tinge the bathroom walls, as they engrave their names. You tinge like a foriegn tongue sparked with ground-to-cloud thunder-whimpers - intraclouded lightning s e e p I NgInto your stormy and penned, paperback eyelids, with an ocean on the cover. Blue-blooded, blue-veined, blue-collared, ocean lover, good swimmer, sometimes blue on tuesdays - In your own murky-blue, ocean tidal wave kind of way. You smoked your cigarette like it was your modus operandi to fame - my modus operandi lead me to a 3:36am, without you here, under sheets creased by one.\"\n    ―\n    Amber Dawn H.\n",

May be he won't able to love you the same way that i do but ya there is someone.... This is my first and only relationship. I know i make lots of mistakes but I swear upon you and my mom that i never ever want to hurt you. There are nights for me in which i just think of myself without you and those nights be so silent that i can hear someone laughing at me Or shall i say that those are the one which literally make me realize my position. Driver for family, termed as useless creature by my father betrayed by my own trust worthies. It feels like time stop at that particular moments and they just want me to haunt it down all through the night. And then comes the time when I'm with you probably spending an hour with you. It seems like life is so good. At that point of time i enjoy the most. Unwillingly i need to drop you back home. Obviously right now I can't or you can't take me home. I had never ever felt so much loved by anyone else. You may think that this guy had copied from net. Once in a while that just comes up. Right!? But just like you do your art work through your heart i do the same. I just express myself to you, my love for you and that is just beyond your imagination.I never ever thought of getting physical or had that mindset to do any such thing with you, your hugs are my favorite and yea \"JAAN\" too. These two things makes up my day. You can compare me to numerous and i would be not a strong guy or may be I don't possess other qualities which many other have but yea i can challenge you that no one can love you as much as i do. I know for you your parents are first in love and I respect this from my heart. I know i have failed many a times and many times and i have disappointed you, i really regret that and I'm trying to not make those silly or may be big mistakes again.When i say I don't watch a girl or don't get my eyes on her I seriously mean it. Because when I'm having one of the most infact best and most beautiful girl with me why should i get keen on seeing or watching out others. I really don't know what em i up to like I don't know about others but ya there are few persons whom i always want smiling my mom you and my brother.

Asentí sin palabras.

Hoy florece; mañana se seca y se tira al horno.» Levantó el penacho verde y se lo llevó a los labios, para luego pasarlo por mi boca. —Estaba muerto, Sassenach, y sin embargo todo ese tiempo te amé. Cerré los ojos sintiendo la leve picazón de la hierba en mis labios. —Yo también te amaba —susurré—. Siempre lo hice. —Mientras mi cuerpo y el tuyo vivan, seremos una sola carne —susurró. Sus dedos me tocaron el pelo, la barbilla, el cuello y los pechos; respiré su aliento y lo sentí en mis manos. —Y cuando mi cuerpo perezca, mi alma todavía será tuya, Claire. Juro por mi esperanza de ganarme el cielo que no seré separado de ti.

Women often tell me that they feel emotionally beaten down when their partners refuse to listen or talk. When women communicate from a place of pain, it is often characterized as 'nagging.' Sometimes women hear repeatedly that their partners are 'sick of listening to this shit.' Both cases undermine self-esteem. Those of us who were wounded in childhood often were shamed and humiliated when we expressed hurt. It is emotionally devastating when the partners we have chosen will not listen. Usually, partners who are unable to respond compassionately when hearing us speak our pain, whether they understand it or not, are unable to listen because that expressed hurt triggers their own feelings of powerlessness and helplessness. Many men never want to feel helpless or vulnerable. They will, at times, choose to silence a partner with violence rather than witness emotional vulnerability. When a couple can identify this dynamic, they can work on the issue of caring, listening to each other's pain by engaging in short conversations at appropriate times (i.e., it's useless to try and speak your pain to someone who is bone weary, irritable, reoccupied, etc.). Setting a time when both individuals come together to engage in compassionate listening enhances communication and connection.

If men were socialized to desire love as much as they are taught to desire sex, we would see a cultural revolution. As it stands, most men tend to be more concerned about sexual performance and sexual satisfaction than whether they are capable of giving and receiving love.\"\n    ―\n    bell hooks,\n    \n      All About Love: New Visions\n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n",

No matter the intensity of this desire, she concludes: 'Few of us evaluate a prospective partner with the same objectivity and clarity that we might use to select a household appliance or a car.' To be capable of critically evaluating a partner we would need to be able to stand back and look critically at ourselves, at our needs, desires, and longings..... We fear that evaluating our needs and then carefully choosing partners will reveal that there is no one for us to love. Most of us prefer to have a partner who is lacking then no partner at all. What becomes apparent is that we may be more interested in finding a partner than in knowing love.\"\n    ―\n    bell hooks,\n    \n      All About Love: New Visions\n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n",

Не затаенное дыхание, не возбуждение, не обещания вечной страсти, не поминутное желание спариваться. Это не значит лежать ночью без сна, представляя, что он целует каждую складочку твоего тела. Нет, ты не красней, я говорю тебе о том, что происходит на самом деле. Очень просто «быть влюбленным», это каждый дурак может. Подлинная любовь – то, что остается, когда перегорит влюбленность, это – и искусство, и счастливый случай. У нас с твоей матерью так было – у нас были корни, что проросли друг в друга под землей, и когда весь красивый цвет облетел с наших ветвей, мы обнаружили, что мы – одно дерево, а не два. Но иногда лепестки опадают, а корни не переплелись. Представь только, что ты бросаешь свой дом и свой народ и через полгода, год, три года понимаешь, что у деревьев не было корней и они рухнули.

The male Australian jewel beetle is hardwired to like certain aspects about the female jewel beetle. They like females to be big, brown, and shiny. The bottles they make love to are bigger, browner, and shinier than any female could ever hope to be. In Australia, a certain type of bottle called stubbies overstimulates male jewel beetles. In a trash heap filled with bottles, you will often see every single stubby covered in male jewel beetles trying to get it on. The stubbies are what evolutionary psychologists call supernormal releasers. They are superstimuli, better than the real thing.

Carnal knowledge. It’s what lovers trust each other with. Knowledge of each other, not of the flesh but through the flesh, knowledge of self, the real him, the real her, in extremis, the mask slipped from the face. Every other version of oneself is on offer to the public. We share our vivacity, grief, sulks, anger, joy… we hand it out to anybody who happens to be standing around, to friends and family with a momentary sense of indecency perhaps, to strangers without hesitation. Our lovers share us with the passing trade. But in pairs we insist that we give ourselves to each other. What selves? What’s left? What else is there that hasn’t been dealt out like a deck of cards? Carnal knowledge. Personal, final, uncompromised. Knowing, being known. I revere that. Having that is being rich, you can be generous about what’s shared — she walks, she talks, she laughs, she lends a sympathetic ear, she kicks off her shoes and dances on the tables, she’s everybody’s and it don’t mean a thing, let them eat cake; knowledge is something else, the undealt card, and while it’s held it makes you free-and-easy and nice to know, and when it’s gone everything is pain. Every single thing. Every object that meets the eye, a pencil, a tangerine, a travel poster. As if the physical world has been wired up to pass a current back to the part of your brain where imagination glows like a filament in a lobe no bigger than a torch bulb. Pain.\"\n    ―\n    Tom Stoppard\n",
